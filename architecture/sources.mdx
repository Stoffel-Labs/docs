# Sources
This is a comprehensive list of resources or referenced when designing and making Stoffel.

This work was created through a mix of independent research and development plus outside sources listed below, though as Newton once said, 'If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants.' Any similarities to existing works not listed are purely coincidental and a testament to the universal nature of good ideas.

<Note>
**Incomplete List Disclaimer**

This list of sources attempts to be as complete as possible. Some sources may have been forgotten or haven't found their way into the list yet!
