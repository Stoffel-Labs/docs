## About Stoffel VM

Stoffel is a framework that enables you to build privacy-first applications using secure Multi-Party Computation (MPC) without needing to be a cryptographer. 

## Key Features
- Stoffel VM: virtual machine architecture designed specifically for secure Multi-Party Computation (MPC) applications. It provides a flexible and efficient foundation for executing MPC protocols while maintaining protocol agnosticism.
- Stoffel compiler: The glue that combines Stoffel Lang and the Stoffel VM
- Stoffel Lang: A Python-styled DSL that allows you to describe an MPC program naturally
- Langauge SDKs: A set of SDKs in popular programming languages that allows you to integrate Stoffel directly where you will need it.

## Current Status

The project is under active development.

## Documentation Structure
The following chapters will guide you through the various aspects of Stoffel:
