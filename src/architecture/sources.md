# Sources
This is a comprehensive list of resources or referenced when designing and making Stoffel.

This work was created through a mix of independent research and development plus outside sources listed below, though as Newton once said, 'If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants.' Any similarities to existing works not listed are purely coincidental and a testament to the universal nature of good ideas.
