# MPC Integration

This section covers how the Stoffel ecosystem integrates with Multi-Party Computation protocols.

## Protocol Architecture

Stoffel is designed to be protocol-agnostic, allowing integration with different MPC protocols while maintaining a consistent interface.

### Current Protocol Support

- **HoneyBadger MPC**: Primary protocol implementation in Rust
- **Configurable Security**: Adjustable threshold parameters
- **Multiple Fields**: Support for BLS12-381, BN254, and other cryptographic fields

## Integration Points

### StoffelVM Integration
- Secret register operations map to MPC protocol primitives
- Automatic secret sharing for values moved to secret registers
- Reveal operations for transitioning from secret to clear

### Network Communication
- Direct node communication for MPC operations
- Optional coordinator for metadata exchange
- Efficient batching of operations for reduced communication rounds

### Python SDK Integration
- High-level API abstracts protocol complexity
- Clear separation between secret and public inputs
- Automatic result reconstruction from secret shares

## Security Model

### Threat Model
- Assumes honest majority with up to `(n-1)/3` corrupted parties
- Protects against semi-honest adversaries
- Configurable security parameters for different scenarios

### Data Protection
- Input privacy through secret sharing
- Computation privacy through secure protocols
- Output privacy with selective reveal operations

## Performance Considerations

### Communication Optimization
- Batched operations to reduce round complexity
- Efficient serialization of protocol messages
- Network topology optimization for latency

### Computational Efficiency
- Native field arithmetic operations
- Optimized secret sharing algorithms
- Parallel computation where possible

This integration enables secure multi-party computation while maintaining developer-friendly abstractions.
