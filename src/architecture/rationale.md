# Design Rationale

## Protocol Agnostic Design

The virtual machine is designed to be protocol-agnostic for several reasons:

1. **Flexibility**
   - Support for different MPC protocols without architectural changes
   - Easy integration of new protocols as they are developed
   - Ability to switch protocols based on specific requirements

2. **Future-Proofing**
   - Not tied to limitations of specific protocols
   - Can adapt to advances in MPC research
   - Supports hybrid protocol approaches

## Extensibility

The architecture emphasizes extensibility through:

1. **Modular Design**
   - Clear separation of concerns
   - Plugin system for new instructions
   - Customizable optimization passes

2. **Abstract Interfaces**
   - Protocol-independent instruction definitions
   - Flexible memory model
   - Extensible register system
